# 🧠 Assembly Language Programs (MASM)

This repository contains a variety of Assembly language programs written using the **MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)**. These programs cover basic to intermediate-level concepts and are great for anyone exploring low-level programming or practicing x86 Assembly.

## 📚 What's Inside?

You'll find simple to slightly advanced programs including:

- 🔢 Input and Output operations  
- 🔁 Loops and arithmetic operations  
- 🧵 String handling  
- 📏 Counting character occurrences  
- ✨ Drawing shapes, patterns, and pyramids  
- 🔄 Newline handling and formatting  
- 📦 Macros and Procedures  
- 🧩 System calls and memory operations  
- 💡and more..

## 🎯 Purpose

These programs were created as part of my learning journey in Assembly language. Most of them are based on exercises and questions from the **Programology** YouTube channel — one of the best resources I found for learning Assembly in MASM.

> ✅ Highly recommended if you're just starting out with Assembly or want hands-on practice with each concept.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Assembler:** MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)
- **Editor:** DOSBox or any text/code editor that supports `.asm` files
- **Platform:** Windows (DOSBox emulated environment)
